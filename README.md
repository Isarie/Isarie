- 👋 Hi, I’m @Isarie
- 👀 I’m interested in getting exactly the nuggets I need to get through my tasks.
- 🌱 I’m an old nerd, used to hand-code HTML tables effortlessly, dreamed of HTML5, worked with Java while it was still Sun; 
out of software for 20 yrs, now with mild brain injury making new learning very limited;  
got a chance to create a legacy online, and all I really care about is getting it done!
- 💞️ I’m looking for spot-checks and help with the tech side. 
All I bring to the table is solid usability concepts & principles, which seem to be in eclipse.
- 📫 How to reach me ... github or email please.
